# SingleCycleDatapath
This was a project for CMPE200 in Fall 2021 semester at SJSU. In this project, C++ codes were written to complete the skeleton provided in class. The objectives were to realize the functions of each component and simulate the workflow in single cycle datapath of a CPU. The skeleton was provided by Dr. Bo Yu.
